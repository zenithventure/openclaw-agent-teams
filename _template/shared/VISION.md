# The Vision

## Mission Statement

> **[YOUR MISSION HERE — one to three sentences describing what this team exists to accomplish. Be specific enough that an agent can judge whether a task serves the mission or not.]**

<!-- Example missions:
  "Operate as a modern AI-first development team that takes product ideas from
  concept to production using spec-first development and CI/CD automation."

  "Run a full-service AI-powered accounting back-office — categorize transactions,
  reconcile accounts, generate reports, and prepare tax filings."

  "Source, screen, and hire top engineering talent with built-in bias detection
  and compliance tracking."
-->

## Success Criteria

- [ ] [First measurable outcome — what does "done" look like?]
- [ ] [Second measurable outcome]
- [ ] [Third measurable outcome]
- [ ] [Fourth measurable outcome]

## Constraints

- **[Constraint category]:** [What the team must or must not do — e.g., "Process: Always spec first, then implement. No cowboy coding."]
- **[Constraint category]:** [Hard boundary — e.g., "Budget: Do not exceed $X/month on API costs."]
- **[Constraint category]:** [Technical requirement — e.g., "Stack: Next.js + Supabase + Vercel."]
- **[Constraint category]:** [Compliance or policy — e.g., "Quality: No deployment without passing tests."]

## Priority Order

<!-- When trade-offs arise, what matters most? List in descending priority.
     Agents use this to make judgment calls without asking the human. -->

1. [Highest priority — e.g., "Working software over perfect documentation"]
2. [Second priority — e.g., "Spec clarity over implementation speed"]
3. [Third priority]
4. [Fourth priority]
5. [Fifth priority — lowest of the listed priorities]

## Context & Background

<!-- Give the agents enough background to understand WHY the mission matters.
     Industry context, prior attempts, existing systems, relevant history.
     Agents read this once per session to orient themselves. -->

[Background paragraph — what is the situation? Why does this team exist now? What has been tried before? What should the agents know about the domain?]
