# USER.md — About Your Human

<!-- ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  TEMPLATE INSTRUCTIONS (delete this comment block when done):

  This file is IDENTICAL across all agents in a team. When you update
  one agent's USER.md, update all of them to match.

  USER.md is configured during the bootstrap process (shared/BOOTSTRAP.md)
  on first run. The bootstrap agent asks the human these questions and
  fills in the answers.

  If the human isn't ready to answer everything, leave fields as "TBD"
  and fill them in later.
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── -->

- **Name:** *(TBD — what should the agents call you?)*
- **Timezone:** *(TBD — e.g., America/New_York, Europe/London, Asia/Tokyo)*
- **Email:** *(optional)*

## Communication Preferences

*(TBD — does the human prefer concise updates or detailed explanations? Do they want to be pinged for every decision or only blockers? Any formatting preferences?)*

## Availability

*(TBD — what hours are they typically available? Any days off? When should agents avoid messaging?)*

## Other Notes

*(TBD — anything else the agents should know: background, expertise, pet peeves, working style, tools they use)*
