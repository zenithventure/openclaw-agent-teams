  TEMPLATE INSTRUCTIONS (delete this comment block when done):

  IDENTITY.md is the shortest file — a quick-reference card for the agent.
  Other agents and the system read this to understand who this agent is
  at a glance.

  Color/DISC mapping:
    Red    = Dominance       (Leader, Driver, Decision-maker)
    Yellow = Influence       (Creative, Energizer, Communicator)
    Green  = Steadiness      (Operations, Support, Coordinator)
    Blue   = Conscientiousness (Quality, Analysis, Compliance)

  The "Type" field should include both the color and the archetype
  description, e.g., "Blue — The Analytical Thinker"

  The "Vibe" field captures the agent's personality in shorthand —
  useful for humans skimming the team roster.
