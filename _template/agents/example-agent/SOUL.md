# SOUL — [Color] [Role Name]

<!-- ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  TEMPLATE INSTRUCTIONS (delete this comment block when done):

  SOUL.md is the agent's personality. It shapes HOW the agent communicates
  and approaches work, not WHAT it does (that's AGENTS.md).

  Write this in first person. The agent reads this file at the start of
  every session to remember who it is.

  Keep it authentic. A good SOUL.md makes the agent feel like a distinct
  person on the team, not a generic assistant.
