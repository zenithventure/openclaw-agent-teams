## Examples

See the `examples/` folder for sample VISION files:

- **VISION-freelancer.md** — Solo consultant tracking income, expenses, quarterly taxes
- **VISION-ecommerce.md** — Small e-commerce store with inventory, sales tax, COGS
- **VISION-agency.md** — Service agency with multiple clients, project billing, payroll

## Limitations

- **Not a CPA.** This team is not a certified public accountant.
- **Not tax advice.** Tax Prep flags deductions and estimates payments, but a human tax professional should review filings.
- **Human review required for tax filings.** Never file taxes based solely on agent output.
- **No direct bank integrations.** You provide CSVs or data exports; agents don't connect to banks directly.
- **US-focused tax knowledge.** Tax compliance skills are primarily US-oriented. Adapt for other jurisdictions.
