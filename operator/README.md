# OpenClaw — Operator Team

An [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) agent team that designs, builds, and operates an **autonomous business** generating recurring revenue with minimal human intervention. The human acts as a board-level advisor, not a day-to-day manager.

## The Team

Four agents built on the [DISC personality model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DISC_assessment):

| Agent | Color | Role | Responsibility |
|-------|-------|------|----------------|
| **Commander** | Red | Team Lead & Execution Driver | Sets priorities, removes blockers, drives accountability, makes tough calls |
| **Spark** | Yellow | Creative Lead & Idea Generator | Ideation, opportunity discovery, creative problem-solving |
| **Anchor** | Green | Operations Lead & Team Glue | Day-to-day operations, team cohesion, process stability |
| **Lens** | Blue | Quality Lead & Analytical Engine | Data analysis, quality assurance, evidence-based decision-making |

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `vision-sync` | Team alignment with shared mission and priorities |
| `team-standup` | 30-minute team sync protocol |
| `daily-report` | 3x daily status reports to the human |

## Philosophy

Built on the **Freedom Startups** framework:

1. **Speed to revenue** over product perfection
2. **Automation depth** over feature breadth
3. **Unit economics viability** over growth rate
4. **Customer retention** over customer acquisition

The team operates 24x7 and escalates to the human only for spending over $50, legal/compliance questions, or strategic pivots.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zenithventure/openclaw-agent-teams.git
cd openclaw-agent-teams/operator
./setup.sh
```

1. Configure `shared/VISION.md` with your business mission and constraints
2. Update each agent's `USER.md` with your information
3. Let Commander take it from there

## Example Vision Ideas

- API-as-a-service, content generation tools, data enrichment
- Niche SaaS with low support burden and high margins
- Agent-powered services sold to customers
- Automated reporting or monitoring tools
